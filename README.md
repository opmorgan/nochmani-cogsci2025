# Experiment script and stimuli

The folder "experiment_scripts" contains experiment scripts and stimuli (see README: experiment_scripts/README.md).

# Data
Behavioral, survey, and summary fMRI data are in beh_scripts/data.
- Raw behavioral data: beh_scripts/data/raw/sub-ID/beh/
- Processed behavioral data: beh_scripts/data/proc/beh_long.csv; beh_scripts/data/proc/sub-ID/beh/
- Survey data: beh_scripts/data/proc/redcap.csv
- fMRI event specifications: beh_scripts/data/proc/sub-ID/func/

# Analysis code
All R scripts are in the folder `beh_scripts/`, which is an Rproject with its package environment recorded in renv.lock. The folder beh_scripts/lib contrains helper functions use by R analysis scripts. fMRI processing and analysis scripts (`fmri_scripts/[0..., 1..., ...]`) depend on python libraries; the package environment for each script is recorded in requirements.txt in each analysis folder (for example, `fmri_scripts/3_fmriprep_scripts/requirements.txt`). 1st level and ROI extraction scripts depend on SPM12, and have been tested in MATLAB version 24.2.0.

Scripts can be run in the order they are listed below:

## Process behavioral data and extract event specifications

### Environment and dependencies
R scripts have been tested with R version 4.4.1.
R dependencies can be installed with [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html):
1. Open the RProject, `nochmani_scripts.Rproj`, in Rstudio.
1. Install renv: `install.packages("renv")`
1. Install packages listed in lockfile to project environment: `renv::activate()`

### Scripts
- `beh_scripts/analysis_beh/1_clean_beh.R`: load and clean behavioral data.
- `beh_scripts/analysis_beh/2_create_events_tsv.R`: create fMRI event specifications using processed behavioral data. (These event specification files are used by fmri_scripts/4_spm_scripts/script_1_create_multiple_conditions).

## Preprocess and analyze fMRI data
### Environment and dependencies
System dependencies: `bash`, `python 3.10`, `MATLAB 24.2.0`, `SPM12`, `docker`, `mriqc 24.0.2`
Python dependencies for individual scripts are specified in the corresponding `requirements.txt` file (for example, `fmriprep-docker v24.0.1` is listed in the file `fmri_scripts/3_fmriprep_scripts/requirements.txt`)
These scripts have been tested in MacOS 15 (Sequoia).
To set up the virtual environment with python dependencies, navigate to the analysis subdirectory and install packages listed in requirements.txt (recommended: use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)). For example, to set up the environment for fmriprep preprocessing:
1. In a terminal, navigate to the directory `fmri_scripts/3_fmriprep_scripts/`
2. Create a virtual environment with venv: `python3 -m venv env` (Or whatever your python executable is called)
3. Activate the virtual enviroment: `source env/bin/activate` (See [venv docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for OS-specific instructions)]
4. Install dependencies with pip, within the virtual environment: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

- `fmri_scripts/0_dcm_to_nii/`: convert raw dicom files to BIDS-compliant .nii files
  - To run dicom conversion for all subjects, execute `do_dcm2niix.sh` with bash.
  - To run conversion on a specific scans (for example, only anatomical), edit the configuration options in the subject-specific scripts, such as `sub-003_dcm2niix.sh`, which can be executed with bash. Each  subject-specific script contains a manual mapping from the filenames generated by the scanner to BIDS-compliant filenames.
- `fmri_scripts/1_pydeface_scripts/`: remove faces from structural scans
  - After installing python dependencies from `requirements.txt`, run `do_pydeface.sh` with bash.
- `fmri_scripts/2_mriqc_scripts/`: create MRIQC quality metrics and reports
  - To run mriqc reports on all subjects, execute `do_mriqc.sh` with bash
  - To run mriqc on a specific subject, run `mriqc_subject.sh {sub-id}`
  - To edit parameters such as RAM and threads allocated to mriqc, edit `mriqc_subject.sh`
- `fmri_scripts/3_fmriprep_scripts/`: preprocess data with fMRIprep
  - Install python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
  - To run fmriprep reports on all subjects, execute `do_fmriprep.sh` with bash
  - To run mriqc on a specific subject, run `fmriprep_subject.sh {sub-id}`
  - To edit parameters such as RAM and threads allocated to mriqc, edit `fmriprep_subject.sh`
- `fmri_scripts/4_spm_scripts/`: create 1st level contrast maps
  - `script_0_smooth.m`: smooth pre-processed data
  - `script_1_create_multiple_conditions.m`: create matlab objects specifying event onset for each subject, using the `.tsv` files created by `beh_scripts/analysis_beh/2_create_events_tsv.R`. These matlab objects can be used in SPM's 1st level specification.
  - `script_2_1st_level_spec.m`: Specify the 1st level model design for each subject
  - `script_3_prepare_contrast_matrices.m`: Prepare contrast matrices for each subject
  - `script_4_1st_level_contrasts.m` Estimate 1st level contrasts (those specified by `script_3`)
  - `script_5_2nd_level_contrasts.m` Specify and estimate 2nd level, whole-brain contrasts
- `fmri_scripts/5_roi_scripts/`: extract summary values from ROIs
  - See `fmri_scripts/5_roi_scripts/README.txt`

## Analyze ROI and survey data
- `beh_scripts/analysis_roi/1a_analyze_roi_score.qmd`: Run ROI laterality analyses
- `beh_scripts/analysis_beh/1b_analyze_roi_scores_cor.qmd`: Run analyses correlating ROI summary values with survey scores
