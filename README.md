For test01, the main changes are:
Added a separate requirements.txt as well as config.sh to the file



In fmri-scripts, please run the following command:

sh config.sh

NOTE: If you do not run this command, the code will not recognize the appropriate pathing. If the command does not work for some reason, you can configure it in the file.

This will set up the directories, making it easy for the computer to recognize.

In addition, there is a full requirements.txt file, so that you do not have to run and create a separate python virtual enviornment every time you want to access a folder.
